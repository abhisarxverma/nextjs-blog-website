# NextPro Blog Project

This project is a simple blog website built by following along with a YouTube tutorial.  
The goal was not to create something original or complex, but to practice and learn modern Next.js patterns in a hands-on way.

## What I Learned
- Server Actions  
- Caching Components  
- Rendering Strategies  
- Streaming with Suspense  
- Using Convex as a database service with realtime features  
- Form validation with Zod  
- Form management with React Hook Form  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
